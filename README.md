# genAI_fundamentals

This repository is dedicated to breaking down the fundamental concepts of Generative AI (genAI) into small, manageable mini-projects. The goal is to provide a hands-on approach to understanding the core techniques, algorithms, and models that power generative AI, with implementations in **Python** (and later **Go**). Each concept is explored through a simple project to reinforce learning and provide practical experience.

## Objectives

- **Learn by Doing**: Each mini-project focuses on a specific genAI concept, making it easier to understand and implement.
- **Progressive Complexity**: Start with simple concepts and build up to more complex models and techniques.
- **Language Flexibility**: Initial projects are built using Python, with plans to extend the exploration into Go.
- **Conceptual Understanding**: Projects will not only focus on code but also explain the theory and intuition behind each generative model or technique.

## Project Structure

Each folder in this repository corresponds to a mini-project focused on a different fundamental concept of generative AI. Each project includes:

- A description of the concept
- Python (and eventually Go) code implementation
- Step-by-step breakdowns and comments in the code
- An explanation of the results and takeaways

### Example Topics

- **Basic Neural Networks for Generation**: Exploring simple feedforward neural networks as a foundation for genAI.
- **Markov Chains**: Modeling sequences with simple probabilistic methods.
- **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)**: Understanding how VAEs are used for generating new data points similar to a training set.
- **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**: Implementing GANs to learn how two networks (generator and discriminator) can compete to produce realistic data.
- **Reinforcement Learning for Generation**: How agent-based learning methods contribute to generative tasks.
- **Transformers**: Breaking down the transformer architecture for text generation tasks like chatbots or story generation.

## Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/genAI_fundamentals.git
    cd genAI_fundamentals
    ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies (Python version):
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. To explore the Go version (coming soon), ensure you have Go installed on your system.

## How to Use

1. Navigate to any project folder to find the code and explanation of the concept.
2. Run the Python scripts to see the concept in action.
3. Read through the explanation to understand the theory behind the code.

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute by:

- Suggesting new concepts to explore.
- Reporting issues or bugs.
- Sharing ideas for improving the implementations.

## Future Goals

- **Expand into Go**: After the initial Python exploration, we'll add Go implementations of the same concepts.
- **Advanced Topics**: Explore more sophisticated generative AI techniques such as diffusion models, neural architecture search, and multimodal generation.
